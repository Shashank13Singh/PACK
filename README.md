# PACK
This is a web-app created with Angular 2 as a part of final semester project made with [Shashank](https://github.com/Shashank13Singh) and [Shubham](https://github.com/shubhamsingh782).
It uses Django based API running on Heroku created by Shubham ([code here](https://github.com/shubhamsingh782/PAC)).
The android app for the same was made by [Shashank](https://github.com/Shashank13Singh).

[Firefox add-on](https://github.com/rahulpsd18/PACK/tree/firefox-addon) and [Chrome add-on](https://github.com/rahulpsd18/PACK/tree/chrome-addon) were also created which can be found in this repository's branches.

## Development Guide
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-rc.1.
### Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
